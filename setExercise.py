# 1. Write a python program to remove an item from a set if it is present in the set.


# st2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 34, 9}

# for x in st2:
#     if x == 6:
#         st2.remove(x)

# print(st2)



# 2. Write a python program to find maximum and the minimum value in a set.


# st2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 34, 9}

# print(max(st2))
# print(min(st2))



# 3. Write a python program to check if two given sets have no elements in common.


# st3_1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 34, 9}
# st3_2 = {5, 7, 11, 10, 13}
# count = 0

# for x in st3_1:
#     for y in st3_2:
#         if y == x:
#             count = 1

# print(st3_1)
# print(st3_2)

# if count == 1:
#     print("Given two sets do have elements in common.")

# else:
#     print("No, given two sets dont have elements in common.")



# 4. Write a python program to remove the intersection of a 2nd set from the 1st set.


# st4_1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 34, 9}
# st4_2 = {5, 7, 9, 11, 10, 13}

# print(st4_1.difference(st4_2))
# print(st4_2)



# 5. Write a python program to find the elements in a given set that are not in another set.


# st5_1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 34, 9}
# st5_2 = {5, 7, 9, 11, 10, 13}

# print(st5_1.difference(st5_2))
# print(st5_2)
